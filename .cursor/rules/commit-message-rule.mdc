description: "Please generate a concise commit message based on the code changes. Follow these rules strictly:  Use Conventional Commits format:  feat: for new features  fix: for bug fixes  chore: for maintenance tasks  docs: for documentation updates  style: for formatting changes (no code logic changes)  refactor: for code refactoring (no new features or fixes)  test: for adding or updating tests  ci: for CI/CD configuration changes  The message must be short, present-tense, and describe what the change does, not what was done.  Only include details relevant to the files that were modified or created.  Do not reference file names directly in the message unless necessary for clarity.  If multiple changes fall under different types, pick the most significant one.  Example Messages: feat: add login functionality fix: resolve signup validation error chore: update dependency versions refactor: simplify user service logic  Generate only the commit message text, no additional explanation."
